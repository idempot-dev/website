Feature: Idempotency-Key Header Compliance
  As a developer implementing the IETF Idempotency-Key Header specification
  I want to verify my middleware complies with the spec
  So that my API handles idempotent requests correctly

  Background:
    Given a POST endpoint at "/api" that creates an order
    And the SQLite store is clean

  # Header Validation (Section 2.1 - Syntax)

  Scenario: Missing Idempotency-Key header on POST returns 400
    When I send a POST request to "/api" without an Idempotency-Key header
    Then the response status should be 400
    And the response content-type should be "application/problem+json"
    And the response body should contain "section-2.1"

  Scenario: Empty Idempotency-Key header returns 400
    Given an empty Idempotency-Key header
    When I send a POST request to "/api" with body '{"foo":"bar"}'
