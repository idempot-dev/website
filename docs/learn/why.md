# Why Idempotency Matters

In distributed systems, networks timeout, load balancers retry, users double-click. Without idempotency, these failures create duplicate transactions: double charges, duplicate orders, inconsistent state.

## The Problem

Duplicate requests happen more often than you'd think:

| Cause            | Example                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| User behavior    | Double-clicking a submit button       |
| Client retries   | Automatic retry on connection timeout |
| Network issues   | Request succeeds but response is lost |
| Load balancers   | Backend timeout triggers retry        |
| Webhook delivery | Provider retries failed deliveries    |

    Client->>Server: POST /api/transfers
    Server-->>Client: 201 Created (response LOST)
    Note over Client: Network timeout<br/>Client retries...
    Client->>Server: POST /api/transfers
    Server-->>Client: 201 Created
    Note over Server: ❌ Duplicate created
```

Each duplicate request creates side effects: duplicate payments, duplicate orders, corrupted data.

## The Pattern

Major APIs like Stripe and PayPal use a simple pattern to solve this:

1. **Client generates a unique key** — typically a UUID for each unique operation
2. **Key sent as header** — `Idempotency-Key: <uuid>`
3. **Server stores key + response** — in your database or cache
4. **On duplicate request** — server returns cached response instead of reprocessing

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Client->>Server: POST /api/transfers<br/>Idempotency-Key: abc-123
    Note over Server: Store key, process request
    Server-->>Client: 201 Created
    Note over Client: Network timeout<br/>Client retries...
    Client->>Server: POST /api/transfers<br/>Idempotency-Key: abc-123
    Note over Server: Key found<br/>Return cached response
    Server-->>Client: 201 Created
    Note over Server: ✅ No duplicate
```

This makes any request safely retryable. The server either processes it once and caches the result, or recognizes the key and returns the previous result.

## Benefits

- **Fault tolerance**: Network interruptions don't cause duplicate transactions
- **Simplified retry logic**: Clients can safely retry without complex deduplication
- **Better UX**: Users don't wonder "did that go through?"
- **API reliability**: Stripe, PayPal, and major processors all use this pattern

Idempot-js implements the [IETF Idempotency-Key Header draft specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header-07) for Node.js, Bun, and Deno applications.
